Somehow, I think I've figured out how to survive in this world. I've also come to understand that the spiral can be a powerful weapon if used properly
I felt that if I could use the spiral better, I would be able to realize a more powerful version of myself. And I would be able to go farther
Next time, I'll try to go around while also practicing.
