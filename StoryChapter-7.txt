You hear that beautiful voice again
I feel you have come into your own in this world
And yet, the courage to start from the beginning again is something that no one can imitate
You have thrown away everything you have accumulated and started over again
However, the road to me still seems endlessly long
But I seem to be even further away
To move further away from the origin, you need to jump into another dimension, the Z-dimension
You have already taken the first step in the prestige you just had
Please open your eyes
You foresaw the beginning of a new journey.
