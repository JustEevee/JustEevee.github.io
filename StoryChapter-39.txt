I am the one who called you into this world
I was able to call you to this world because you were about to give up living in your previous world and I strongly wished to help you
I wish three things for you
The first is a wish that when you return to your former world, you will live properly
The second is my wish that you remember to keep going anyway, just like you did when you were little
I am sure that you have made it so far in this world that you have already regained this feeling.
