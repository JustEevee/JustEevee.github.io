I can't hear the beautiful voice
The Flower Challenge seems to have been unlocked
Speaking of flowers, I think there were many light pink flowers where I grew up
I realized that although I had the knowledge, only the memory of my previous life was completely lost
I can't believe I'm realizing this now
Just why do I feel so sad when I remember those flowers?
