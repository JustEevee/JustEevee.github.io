Third, I want you to know that I am grateful to you
This world is created by my thoughts
The spiral of this world are not the whirlpools that killed me
Do you not remember?
The Spiranthes that you and I went to the park and found
It is my best flower, blooming like a spiral and teaching me about the wonder and beauty of nature
I was so happy to be friends with you.
