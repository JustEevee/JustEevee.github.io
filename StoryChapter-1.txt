So dark. And you feel nothing
Welcome to the world of Idle Spiral
You hear someone's beautiful voice. You try to respond, but your voice won't come out.

I'm sure you have no idea what's going on right now, so let me explain to you what's going on in this world
Believe it or not, in this world, you can only go around in circles
your value is measured by your distance "r" from the origin.

In the previous world, you may have been valued for your wealth or your looks
But in this world, neither will help you
Please do not be depressed when you hear this
Any effort will lead to "r".

I am in a very distant place, but due to circumstances, I cannot move from here
But if you can increase "r", we might be able to meet
It may be a very, very long way, but I will be here waiting for you.

You had no idea who or what she was talking about
But no matter how you moved your body, all you could do was spin around in circles
You decided to leave the origin.
