It's been a while since I've heard that beautiful voice
You have gone on for a long time to get to where I am.
I'm very happy for your efforts, but I'm very sorry that I couldn't meet you. 
I thought that the world you are in and the world I am in are the same, but unfortunately they are similar but different.
You are valued more than anyone else in that world, so please forget about me and live happily ever after.
I made it to the border of this world, but I couldn't meet the owner of that beautiful voice. 
I thought that you have become like a god in this world, and that you can even change the rules of the world.
