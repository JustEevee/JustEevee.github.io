This world, as the beautiful voice said, seems to be all about r
In order to increase the amount of r, you have to consume r
In the world I was in before, in order to increase money, I had to invest it
In order to create time, you had to spend time
Is it a common rule in all worlds that you have to lose something to gain something?
If that's the case, maybe if you start over from the beginning, you will get something better
You decide to go back to your starting point.
